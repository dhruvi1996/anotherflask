        <h4 class="neonblue"><u>What is AAA testing?</u></h4>️ ️
        <p class="fs-20"><span class="fs-4">T</span>he AAA pattern is a pattern for structuring tests.<h6
            class="neonblue"> AAA stands for: Arrange, Act, Assert.</h6>
        <p>
            The state of the data to set it up for testing.It will basically perform the setup and
            initialization required for the test. In other words, each step in the pattern is a function whose return
            value is the input of the following step.This pattern has several significant benefits. It creates a clear
            separation between a test's setup, operations, and results. This structure makes the code easier to read and
            understand. If you place the steps in order and format your code to separate them, you can scan a test and
            quickly comprehend what it does. Arrange-Act-Assert is powerful because it is simple. It forces tests to
            focus on independent, individual behaviors. It separates setup actions from the main actions. It requires
            test to make verifications and not merely run through motions.

                <h5 class="neonblue"><u>Arrange</u></h5>
                <p><span class="fs-4">T</span>he block of code that sets up the conditions for the test
                    action.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Arrange</strong> inputs and targets. Arrange steps should set up the test case. Here we have
                    to use a single block of code with no empty lines. Setup the testing objects and prepare the
                    prerequisites for your test.
                    So in the arrange section you only have code required to setup that specific test. Here objects would
                    be created, mocks setup (if you are using one) and potentially expectations would be set.
                    The Arrange section should be large enough to create a class you want to test and set up the test data. Ideally, a couple of lines.

                    <strong>Act</strong> – perform the actual work of the test.The Act section should be one line.
                    Call the method or unit you want to test, and that’s it. The image shows how testing for calculator
                    methods for addition, subtraction and multiplication is broken down to show Arrange, Act and Assert.
                    we will do the actual unit testing and the result will be obtained from the test application.
                    Basically we will call the targeted function in this step using the object that we created in the
                    previous step.

                <p>
                    <strong>Assert</strong> section should ideally contain only one assert method to verify that
                    the Act section has performed as expected. The Assert part of the test code is the section where you
                    actually verify that your code behaves the way you intend it to. It usually includes one assertion
                    for each of the features or scenarios covered in the Act section.
                    It is the block of code that performs the assertions on
                    the state of the SUT after the action.
                    Here we use a single block of code with no empty lines.Limit the actions that you make in
                    this block. Ideally, no actions should happen, but that is not always possible, instead we Use
                    simple blocks of assertions. If you find that you are repeatedly writing the same code to
                    extract information from the SUT and perform assertions on it, then consider extracting an assertion
                    helper.

                <p class="fs-4">
                There are many benefits of AAA in unit testing, but the main one is that it saves time.
                <li> It saves time because it helps developers write a test without thinking about how to structure the
                    unit test method. With AAA, developers just follow the instructions that are provided to them.

                    In addition, you can use AAA for a variety of types of testing, including integration testing,
                    system testing, and acceptance testing.

                <h5 class="neonblue"><u>Why is testing important???</u></h5>

            <p class="fs-20"><span class="fs-4">G</span>oal of unit testing :</p>
                    <p>Unit testing has the greatest effect
                    on the quality of your code when it's an integral part of your software development workflow
                    if software testing is performed effectively from the initial stage of product development.
                    Software testing has to be taken up from the very first stage, i.e. from the code level itself; and
                    this can be achieved when software developers perform the unit testing.
                    With a proper unit testing practice in place, the developers and testers can help to save time as
                    bugs can be identified early in the process as it is the initial phase of testing.It is essential to
                    practice unit testing at the initial stage of the software testing process before planning for the
                    integration testing.These unit test cases are written and executed by software developers.
                    Unit testing makes your code future proof since you anticipate the cases where your code could
                    potentially fail or produce a bug. Though you cannot predict all of the cases, you still address
                      most of them.

                    <div class="col-6">
                        <p> The testing makes sure
                            that  problems we catch in the first stages of the development, can be
                            fixed by
                            the development team.Automated testing is the only proven method for building reliable
                            software once
                            they grow past the point of a simple prototype. Many major software program development
                            failures can be
                            traced back to inadequate or a complete lack of testing.

                            It's impossible to know whether software works properly unless it is tested. While testing
                            can be done
                            manually, by a user clicking buttons or typing in input, it should be performed
                            automatically by writing
                            software programs that test the application under test.

                            There are many forms of testing and they should all be used together. When a single function
                            of a
                            program is isolated for testing, that is called unit testing. Testing more than a single
                            function in an
                            application at the same time is known as integration testing. User interface testing ensures
                            the
                            correctness of how a user would interact with the software.</p></div>
