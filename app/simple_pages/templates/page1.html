                    Docker is an open source containerization platform. It enables developers to package applications
                    into
                    containers—standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating
                    system
                    (OS)
                    libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.
                    Docker Cloud uses Docker Hub as its native registry for storing both public and private
                    repositories. Once
                    you
                    push your images to Docker Hub, they will be available in Docker Cloud.

                <p>
                    Image result for what is docker container
                    In simple terms, a Docker Image is a template that contains the application, and all the
                    dependencies
                    required to run that application on Docker. On the other hand, as stated earlier, a Docker Container
                    is
                    a
                    logical entity. In more precise terms, it is a running instance of the Docker Image.

                <p>
                    The ‘docker pull’ is a Docker command to download a Docker image or a repository locally on the
                    host from a public or private registry. When we run any container and the specified Docker image
                    is not present locally then it first pulls it from the registry.
                    After image is pulled one should navigate to a folder containing image and from
                    there it can be started using command <em>docker compose up --build</em>
