        <p class="fs-20 mt--2"><span class="fs-4">P</span>ytest is a testing framework based on python.</p>
            <p>It is mainly used to write API test cases.
            Pytest is the framework that makes it easy to write, test, and
            scale
            to support complex testing for the applications and libraries. It is the most popular Python package for
            testing. The basis for a rich ecosystem of testing is plugins and extensions.
            The way pytest is designed is as a very extensible system, easy to write plugins and there are a lot of
            plugins present in the pytest that are used for various purposes. Testing is very important before
            delivering the code in production.</p>

                    It can also look for certain type errors, it can recommend suggestions
                    about how particular blocks can be refactored and can offer you details about the code's complexity.
                    If you are coding in Python, the computer does not catch bugs for you. Therefore, you need a lint
                    tool, like Pylint, to find errors. The default coding style used by Pylint is similar to PEP 8.
                    Pylint will display number of messages as it does code analysis and code are given an
                    overall mark based on number and severity of warnings and errors.
                    itself. It is a preferred tool having special abilities to check length of code, provides
                    the ability to check code as per coding standards such as well-formed variable names.
                    This also checks if user is using imported modules.

                            You should give Pylint the name of a
                            python package or module, or some number of packages or modules. Pylint will not import this
                            package or module, though uses Python internals to locate them and as such is subject to the
                            same rules and configuration.

                        <p><strong>Pylint</strong>  is fully user customizable and has integral special functions to
                            control individual errors and alerts within the user’s code. It gives user flexibility to
                            write their own custom plugin and executable from an extensive configuration file.

                    <p class="fs-20"><span class="fs-4">C</span>overage is a tool for measuring code coverage of
                        Python programs. It monitors your program,
                        noting which parts of the code have been executed, then analyzes the source to identify code
                        that
                        could have been executed but was not.

                        Coverage measurement is typically used to gauge the effectiveness of tests. It can show which
                        parts
                        of your code are being exercised by tests, and which are not.</p>

                            Critical missed lines should always be addressed. Good judgment on what to put time into is
