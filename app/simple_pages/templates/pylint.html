        <p class="fs-20 mt--2"><span class="fs-4">P</span>ytest is a testing framework based on python.</p>
        <p>It is mainly used to write API test cases.
            Pytest is the framework that makes it easy to write, test, and
            scale
            to support complex testing for the applications and libraries. It is the most popular Python package for
            testing. The basis for a rich ecosystem of testing is plugins and extensions.
            The way pytest is designed is as a very extensible system, easy to write plugins and there are a lot of
            plugins present in the pytest that are used for various purposes. Testing is very important before
            delivering the code in production.</p>

                    about how particular blocks can be refactored and can offer you details about the code's complexity.
                    If you are coding in Python, the computer does not catch bugs for you. Therefore, you need a lint
                    tool, like Pylint, to find errors. The default coding style used by Pylint is similar to PEP 8.
                    Pylint will display number of messages as it does code analysis and code are given an
                    overall mark based on number and severity of warnings and errors.
                    itself. It is a preferred tool having special abilities to check length of code, provides
                    the ability to check code as per coding standards such as well-formed variable names.
                    This also checks if user is using imported modules.

                            Pylint is meant to be called from the command line.
                            You should give Pylint the name of a
                            python package or module, or some number of packages or modules. Pylint will not import this
                            package or module, though uses Python internals to locate them and as such is subject to the
                            same rules and configuration.

                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Pylint</strong> is fully user customizable and has integral special functions to
                            control individual errors and alerts within the user’s code. It gives user flexibility to
                            write their own custom plugin and executable from an extensive configuration file.

                    <p><span class="fs-4">C</span>overage Coverage.py is a tool for measuring code
                        coverage of Python programs. It monitors your program, noting which parts of the code have been
                        executed, then analyzes the source to identify code that could have been executed but was not.
                        Coverage measurement is typically used to gauge the effectiveness of tests.
                        Code coverage is a metric that can help you understand how much of your source is tested. It's a
                        very useful metric that can help you assess the quality of your test suite, and we will see here
                        how you can get started with your projects.

                            result-driven, sophisticated codes by implementing code coverage tools.
                            Levels between 70 and 90 percent suggest reliable software, according to a review of
                            academic studies that examined the correlation between software quality and code coverage.
                            As we can see in the figure coverage is shown in the terminal with command pytest --cov.

                            The unit test framework in Python is called unittest, which comes packaged with Python.
                            unittest.main() provides a command-line interface to the test script.On running the above
                            script from the command line.During test case execution, various frameworks log tests that
                            fail any criterion and report them in a summary. The developers are expected to write
                            automated test scripts, which ensures that each and every section or a unit meets its design
                            and behaves as expected.
                            Unit testing makes your code future proof since you anticipate the cases where your code
                            could
                            potentially fail or produce a bug. Though you cannot predict all of the cases, you still
