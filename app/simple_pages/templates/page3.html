        <p><u><span class="font25">Git</span></u> : is installed and maintained on your local system and gives you a
            self-contained
            record of your ongoing programming versions.
            It is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
            It
            is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of
            files.
            Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
            It is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system
            used
            to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code,
            enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.

                <h4><u>GitHub</u></h4>
                <p><span class="fs-3">G</span>itHub: is a web-based Git repository hosting service, which offers all
                    of the distributed revision
                    control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.
                    GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service.
                    Essentially, it
                    makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.
                    GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git. Without
                    GitHub,
                    using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line.
                    GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as
                    well as
                    track and control changes to their code.

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong class="high">Repository</strong> : The first step is always to create a new local repository.
                            A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can
                            discuss and
                            manage your project's work within the repository.
                            The git clone command is used to create a copy of a specific repository or branch within a
                            repository.
                            As, for this website I have cloned professor Keith Williams's repository to mine and update
                            the way wanted to show.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong class="high">Branch</strong> : A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of
                            these
                            commits. The default branch name in Git is <u>master</u> . As you start making commits,
                            you're given a
                            master
                            branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the master branch
                            pointer moves
                            forward automatically.I have merged my contents on the master branch. That brings to next
                            topic.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong class="high">Merge</strong> : Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together
                            again. The git
                            merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and
                            integrate
                            them into a single branch.It takes the contents of a source branch and integrates it with a
                            target
                            branch.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong class="high">Commit</strong> : The "commit" command is used to save your changes to the local
                            repository.
                            It sends the latest changes of the source code to the repository, making these changes part
                            of the head
                            revision of the repository.We make changes in our files and doing command git commit.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong class="high">Pull</strong> : Pull request is a process for a developer to notify team members
                            that they have
                            completed a feature. Once their feature branch is ready, the developer files a pull request
                            via their
                            remote server account. Pull request announces all the team members that they need to review
                            the code and
                            merge it into the master branch.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong class="high">Push</strong> : The Git push command is used to push the local repository content to
                            a remote
                            repository. After a local repository has been modified, a push is executed to share the
                            modifications
                            with remote team members. Pushing is the way commits are transferred from the local
                            repository to the
                            remote repository.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong class="high">Tags</strong> :
                            Tags mark a specific commit at a point in your repository history. When you tag a commit,
                            you're
                            including all the changes before it. You can later compare tags to see the difference
                            between two points
                            in history. Tags are commonly used to mark release versions, with the release name as the
                            tag name.
                        </li>
